Mirror list optimizer (mlopt)


Mlopt is designed to organize your mirrorlist. It fetches JSON data from archlinux.org and uses 
that to sort your new mirror list. The *exact* line you have in your mirror list will be used for 
writting the new list. Mlopt will not work with incomplete servers, meaning that everything it sorts 
will be a complete server. 


[options]

--w "Write to path"
--r "Read from path"
--sort "Sort by score, last_sync, delay"
--v "Show more output"
--i "Display incomplete servers"

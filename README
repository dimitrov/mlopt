Mirror list optimizer (mlopt)

Mlopt is designed to organize your mirrorlist. It fetches JSON data from archlinux.org and uses 
that to sort your new mirror list. The *exact* line you have in your mirror list will be used for 
writting the new list. 



[options]

--w "write to [path]
--a "append to [path]"
--r "Read from [path]"
--sort "Sort by [score], [last_sync], [delay]"
--v "Show more output"
--i "Display incomplete servers"


Example usage:

# Read from another file, then write mirrorlist. 
mlopt --r /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew --w /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist --sort score

# Print servers by score
mlopt --sort score

# Print servers by delay
mlopt --sort delay -v

# Print servers by last_sync (latest are shown first)
mlopt --sort last_sync
